# Challenge Summary

Make a method that takes two inputted HashMaps, and returns a structure where keys that appear in both trees have all values stored in them.

## Approach & Efficiency

First we check the first Table for all its keys, then we check the second map for all the keys in there. Really we coded this as a class and it got away from us and we went down a path few of us thought through, so I'll revisit this tomorrow.

## Solution

Why explain what doesn't work?
